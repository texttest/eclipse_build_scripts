How to install RCP/GEF test environment from scratch

   1. Check out the build scripts from /carm/proj/texttest/bzr/eclipse_build_scripts
   2. From StoryText check out import eclipse_rcp_plugin and eclipse_gef_rcp_plugin into your workspace
   3. Check out all eclipse test applications from /carm/proj/texttest/bzr/eclipse_applications and import them into your eclipse workspace
   4. Select org.storytext.rcp.installation and open defaultInstallation.product file. Click on “Eclipse Product export wizard” from the overview tab at the bottom left.
    * In “Root directory” text field write “eclipse”
    * In destination directory click browse and point to /usr/local/tt-env/eclipse_test
    * Click finish
    * Open the file /usr/local/tt-env/eclipse_test/eclipse/configuration/config.ini. Find the text "eclipse.product=org.storytext.rcp.installation.product"
      and remove it.
    Repeat this step for the GEF product but change the “Root directory” text field to “eclipse_gef”
    Note that it is important to execute this step from a eclipse version that matchs the target eclipse version.

   5. Open any plugin.xml file from an application and choose export wizard from the overview tab.
   6. From the overview tab, select all applications and testscripts for rcp and gef . Choose a destination directory and click finish.
   7. Cd to the build scripts directory
   8. Run the script :
      make_testenv_rcp_gef.sh <eclipse version> <root of the installation> <artifact directory. (The destination directory in step 6)>
      I.e. make_testenv_rcp_gef.sh 3.7 /usr/local/tt-env /users/uname/artifacts
